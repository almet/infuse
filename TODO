Here is the list of things to do:

* do not use user profiles, but users instead. This mean that I have to:
    * justify this choice
    * explain why getting profiles is not a so good idea
    * explain why directly clustering users is a better idea.
    * Why not, explaining it with clusters that have been found
* Using the LDA approach to find a list of topics. VW is a good candidate here
* Creates an interface to ask user specific feedback, train a model with thoses and
  infer the rest
* Find literature about clustering locations
* How can I use the browsing flow ?
