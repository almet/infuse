<h2>Thanks !</h2>
<p>Thank you for registering an account. The last step is to 
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/infuse/">install the firefox plugin</a>. 

The plugin needs firefox 4 or later and is based on the jetpack SDK and will send 
data about:

<ul>
    <li>The different actions you do on your browser such as: opening a new tab, loading
    new content in an existing tab and closing a tab.</li>
    <li>Your geographical position, in order to determine the different browsing 
    contexts</li>
</ul>
</p>
