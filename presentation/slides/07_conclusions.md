## Limits

.fx: bigbullet

* Need a huge number of entries to be accurate; More than with a classic approach
* The ranking is made with heuristics (can be wrong ones)
* We can use the content-based approach with web **pages** not web **applications**
* Clustering is expensive (time-wise)

## Ethical issues

.fx: bigbullet

* The data is centralised (like Google, Facebook etc)
* Sensible data (locations, web pages)
* Serendipity: user are not discovering new topics

## Results

.fx: bigbullet

* It is possible to have text-based clusters to determine profiles
* The browsing data can be extracted to feed clustering algorithms
* The data contained in browsers can be extracted to feed a recommendation system

<!-- TODO -->
